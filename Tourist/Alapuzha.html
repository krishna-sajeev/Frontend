Alappuzha, also known by its anglicized name Alleppey, is one of the most captivating and picturesque districts in the Indian state of Kerala. Known as the “Venice of the East”, Alappuzha is a mosaic of shimmering backwaters, tranquil lakes, long stretches of paddy fields, and swaying coconut palms. The charm of Alappuzha lies not just in its scenic landscape but also in its rich cultural heritage, timeless traditions, and the warm hospitality of its people.<br>
<h5>A Glimpse into History</h5>
Alappuzha has a fascinating history rooted in maritime trade. During the 18th and 19th centuries, it served as a bustling port town under the rule of Raja Keshawadasan, the Diwan of Travancore. Its strategically important location made it a major center for spice trade and coir products. The town was among the first in Kerala to adopt planned urban development and saw the early establishment of canals, warehouses, and lighthouses, some of which still stand today as silent witnesses to its vibrant past.
